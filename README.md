# j220-final-project
A web design project to present the story about Chinese senior immigrants who move to the U.S. to live with their kids, and the challenges in that process.
I did the reporting, design, illustration, photography and the coding all by myself. Thanks to Soo Oh and Yoli Martinez for their support. 
*This is the final project for J220 at UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.*
